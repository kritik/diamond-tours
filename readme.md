## What's it good at?

__Refinery is great for sites where the client needs to be able to update their website themselves__ without being bombarded with anything too complicated.

Unlike other content managers, Refinery is truly __aimed at the end user__ making it easy for them to pick up and make changes themselves.

### For developers

* Easily __[Theme and customise](http://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/blob/master/vendor/plugins/themes/readme.md)__ the look to suit the business

## Installing and Setting Up Refinery

### 1. Get the Refinery code

#### Install the Gem

    gem install refinerycms
    refinery path/to/project

#### Or, clone Refinery's GIT repository

    git clone git://github.com/resolve/refinerycms.git mynewsite.com
    cd ./mynewsite.com
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin git@github.com:you/yournewsite.git
    mv ./config/database.yml.example ./config/database.yml

### 2. Configuration

Firstly, edit ``config/database.yml`` to reflect your database server details.

Next create your database and fill it with Refinery's default data:

    rake db:setup

After your database exists, you'll need to install the gems that Refinery depends on. You can do this by running:

    rake gems:install

Note: The news engine that was previously in Refinery's core was extracted into a separate gem / plugin to be found here:p
